    "This repository concerns the textbook <u>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</u> \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the unreasonable effectiveness of asking for help\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of notebooks takes up the study of number theory, \n",
    "inspired by two people: Caltech mathematics professor Tom Apostol\n",
    "and Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner. Further \n",
    "inspiration was provided by Paul Erdös and Ross Honsberger. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways here\n",
    "is a story I made up:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> A student of rock climbing was led by his instructor to a rock \n",
    "> formation one day. 'Here is a problem: Climb to the top' the instructor\n",
    "> said, pointing to a vertical cliff face. Whereupon (the instructor\n",
    "> having departed) the student examined the cliff face and found it\n",
    "> to be vertical, smooth and featureless. There was not so much as a\n",
    "> tiny bump of a handhold. The student sat upon the ground, staring at\n",
    "> the cliff. A year later he returned to his instructor. 'I have not\n",
    "> solved the problem yet' he announced in a despondent voice.\n",
    "> 'Oh?...' his instructor replied '...I assumed you had died.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my \n",
    "purse, and nothing particular to interest me in my home town, I thought I would \n",
    "travel about a little and see the learned part of the world. In due course I arrived \n",
    "at the California Institute of Technology where I had the privilege of attending \n",
    "Professor Apostol's lectures on calculus and related topics. In keeping with the \n",
    "Institute's undergraduate culture of irreverence, my fellow classmates and I referred \n",
    "to Tom Apostol as '*Tommy*'. I see him in my mind's eye standing before the blackboard \n",
    "in Noyes Laboratory, all business delivering a lecture on a version of calculus \n",
    "much more *carefully explained* relative to what we had seen in highschool. This was\n",
    "our introduction to mathematical rigor. At certain points in the narrative he would pause\n",
    "for dramatic effect and make an impossible, outrageous mathematical claim. There would \n",
    "follow another pause to let the claim register... we might scoff 'oh please' but \n",
    "only quietly to ourselves... and then Professor \n",
    "Apostol would continue with a portentous remark, \"Now nobody can stop me from *making \n",
    "this claim*...\". He was daring us to guess how it might in fact be true. \n",
    "And then his logical argument would follow step by step, at the end of which we were\n",
    "convinced: The ridiculous claim was quite reasonable. It became part of what was true. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As Freshmen we did not always appreciate the fun in this narrative style. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In retrospect I appreciate Tommy's lecture style now. He took the burden of proof\n",
    "very seriously, never took the easy way out typified by the phrase 'it turns out that...' \n",
    "Plus his pace of delivery always gave one a sense of forging ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My intent here is to circle back and start over with Tommy on the topic of analytic \n",
    "number theory. Working with prime numbers and composites begins in grade school, \n",
    "accompanied by some confusion over the status of $1$. The first chapter of Tommy's book\n",
    "**Introduction to Analytic Number Theory** (abbreviated ANT here) provides a brief\n",
    "Historical Introduction before charging forward with non-intuitive building blocks\n",
    "centered on the greatest common divisor. Chapter two introduces the Möbius $\\mu(n)$ \n",
    "function and Euler's totient $\\varphi(n)$; and then Dirichlet multiplication. \n",
    "These two chapters are my price of admission. They are the smooth rock face one \n",
    "climbs to reach the next plateau of topics: The distribution of primes, finite Abelian \n",
    "groups, quadratic reciprocity, ... and far off in the distance in chapter 12 the \n",
    "mysterious Riemann zeta function itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I refer to the metaphor of the student rock climber. He is intended as the\n",
    "other fool I should learn from. I have no pretention of mathematical talent \n",
    "but I have spent enough time trying to solve math problems to conclude that \n",
    "an honest try is worth a shot. After that reaches a dead end: Getting help is \n",
    "in no sense a failure. To this end, two persons have preceded me in writing \n",
    "up public solutions to ANT problems: One Sean Li and the estimable Greg (Chip)\n",
    "Hurst. I rely primarily on Chip's remarkable ANT solution set available for\n",
    "download online in *pdf* format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm writing solutions in one notebook and working examples in another; so\n",
    "each chapter gets two notebooks. In support of the Python code I am developing\n",
    "a module called **`ant`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So: For a given problem my method is some variant of this procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the problem in the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- Work some examples\n",
    "- Write some test code in the examples notebook\n",
    "    - Expand the `ant.py` module if necessary\n",
    "- Refer to the text, try out some ideas\n",
    "- Best case: I solve it and write it up\n",
    "- More common case: I'm stuck\n",
    "    - Take a look at Chip's solution\n",
    "        - A glance is sufficient: Write it up\n",
    "        - A lot of staring is necessary: Eventually write it up\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My aesthetic is trying to lean towards readability: I should be able to read a\n",
    "solution without accompanying pen and paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That takes care of motivation, obective and method.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back further in my personal history: Early on I discovered a dichotomy as \n",
    "I struggled to make sense of the world. To begin with, the book **Dinosaurs and More Dinosaurs** \n",
    "(1971) made it clear that there really are -- or were -- monsters; but they were monsters\n",
    "who did not know or care about me. Their existence indicated that the world really was more fantastical \n",
    "than anything I could imagine. But dinosaurs were not the only clue. I also found two books \n",
    "written about an easily annoyed girl named Alice. Here the matter was clearly fiction but\n",
    "nevertheless I found it to be a world that I wanted to *inhabit*... so I became lost in the\n",
    "story until it ended; and upon setting it down I found myself back in the ordinary world \n",
    "where we think nothing of falling off the roof owing to practical consequences. So now \n",
    "the dichotomy: Is this (actual) world we inhabit ordinary or is it extraordinary? Dinosaurs \n",
    "and Red Queens are real when the book is open... but what happens when the book closes? \n",
    "Do they persist? I responded in what seemed the only logical way: I looked for more books.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In middle school I discovered computers and Martin Gardner. The latter was at first merely\n",
    "the name on the by-line of the recurring *Mathematical Games* feature in Scientific American. \n",
    "Whoever he was, Mr. Gardner invited us to climb up onto the mantle above the fireplace and peer\n",
    "into the Looking Glass room. Then as the mirror dissolved in\n",
    "a mist we were further invited to pass through and climb\n",
    "back down. Here ideas mattered in proportion to their strangeness.\n",
    "We learned from his bemused tour guide voice about logic puzzles, \n",
    "paradoxes, prisoners both clever and unfortunate, inward-exploding \n",
    "fractals, planar graphs, clever colored maps, games about the search \n",
    "for truth, and practical advice on how to work in four dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I would like to present the backbone of yes / no / unknown as what made the Gardner world finally real\n",
    "    - Dinosaurs are real but long gone... unless we care to turn our focus to birds\n",
    "    - Fiction makes no pretensions of being actual\n",
    "    - Mathematics suffers the burden of being provable\n",
    "        - But still exceeds anything we might find in a dream or a drawing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having arrived at this state of being, 'there is a big world to discover', \n",
    "the question evolves into 'How then shall we explore?' The fuse is lit, \n",
    "we are off to explore. But what happens when the trail grows cold, when\n",
    "we hit a wall, run out of ideas to try? This is the point of the story\n",
    "of the rock climbing student. Consider an indirect method where one develops \n",
    "a skill called 'getting help'.  \n",
    "Sometimes help is not available. Sometimes sources of \n",
    "help are hidden. Sometimes they walk away and we have to go chase them\n",
    "down. Of course the reverse can be true as well: We can become so\n",
    "habituated to help that we become fearful of the problem. So there is \n",
    "a balance to strike; but I feel that it is too easy to err on the \n",
    "side of not finding that help. \n",

    "\n",
    "The PFT Theorem: *Any positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This proof presumes the theorem to be *false* and arrives at a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify one point: A *unique* prime factorization $F(N > 1)$ is a set of prime numbers $\\{ p_i \\}$ such that \n",
    "$\\prod p_i = N$. This set is order-independent and prime factors may appear in the set more \n",
    "than once, as in $F(36) = \\lbrace 3, 2, 2, 3 \\rbrace$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the theorem is false: There are positive integers with two or more distinct prime factorizations.\n",
    "Then there is a smallest such number $S$ such that any number less than $S$ has but one prime factorization.\n",
    "Such an $S$ is certainly greater than $7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ can be factored in two ways: $S = \\alpha \\cdot A$ and $S = \\beta \\cdot B$. Here $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\n",
    "are distinct prime factors of $S$ so $\\alpha \\ne \\beta$ (or they could be used to produce a number with\n",
    "two distinct prime factorizations less than $S$). $A$ and $B$ are the residual factors in the respective\n",
    "factorizations so they could be prime or composite. \n",

    "\n",
    "For definiteness let us take $\\alpha < \\beta$ in turn implying $A > B$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since $\\alpha < \\beta$ and $B < A$ we can infer that both $A - B$ and $\\beta - \\alpha$ are positive even numbers. \n",
    "Hence $\\beta$ is equal to $\\alpha$ plus an even number that we can parameterize as $2r$: $\\beta = \\alpha + 2r$. \n",
    "In like fashion we have $A = B + 2q$. The difference parameters $q$ and $r$ are both positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After substitution we have $S = \\alpha \\cdot (B + 2 q) = (\\alpha + 2 r) \\cdot B$. \n",

    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}(q \\alpha = r B) < S\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $q \\alpha$ is less than $S$ it has only one prime factorization. \n",
    "Since $\\alpha$ is not one of the factors in the prime factorization of $B$ it must be a factor of $r$ so we can introduce \n",

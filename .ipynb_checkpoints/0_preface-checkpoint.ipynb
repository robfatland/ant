    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository concerns the textbook <u>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</u> \n",
    "by Tom Apostol. This introduction -- I have attempted to make it interesting -- \n",
    "goes over my motivation and my approach to solving the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$LaTeX$ is the document preparation system in use; so to help reduce look-ups\n",
    "I include a $LaTeX \\; patterns$ notebook.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the unreasonable effectiveness of asking for help\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of notebooks takes up the study of number theory, \n",
    "inspired by two people: Caltech mathematics professor Tom Apostol\n",
    "and Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner. Further \n",
    "inspiration was provided by Paul Erdös and Ross Honsberger. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a story I made up:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> A student of rock climbing was led by his instructor to a rock \n",
    "> formation one day. 'Here is a problem: Climb to the top' the instructor\n",
    "> said, pointing to a vertical cliff face. Whereupon (the instructor\n",
    "> having departed) the student examined the cliff face and found it\n",
    "> to be vertical, smooth and featureless. There was not so much as a\n",
    "> tiny bump of a handhold. The student sat upon the ground, staring at\n",
    "> the cliff. A year later he returned to his instructor. 'I have not\n",
    "> solved the problem yet' he announced in a despondent voice.\n",
    "> 'Oh?...' his instructor replied '...I assumed you had died.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tommy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little money in my \n",
    "pocket, and nothing particular to interest me in my home town, I thought I would \n",
    "travel off to a learned corner of the world to see how things were done there. \n",
    "In due course I arrived at the California Institute of Technology where I was \n",
    "compelled to attend Professor Tom Apostol's lectures on calculus for freshmen. \n",
    "Per the Institute's culture of undergraduate irreverence, my fellow classmates and I \n",
    "found that Professor Apostol was to be referred to (in the dorms) as '*Tommy*'; \n",
    "and this was also how one referred to his two-volume textbook on calculus. (I still\n",
    "have my copies to this day.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I can easily see Tommy \n",
    "in my mind's eye: Standing before the blackboard in Noyes Laboratory, shirt sleeves\n",
    "rolled up, a rather formal demeanor, without any ceremony launching into the day's \n",
    "remarks. We quickly noticed two things: First, matters were much more \n",
    "*carefully explained* in comparison with high school calculus. This was a clue,\n",
    "our introduction to mathematical rigor. And second, Tommy's lectures were never\n",
    "slow; in fact a better term would be *inexhorable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At certain points in his narrative Tommy would pause for dramatic effect and \n",
    "make an impossible, an outrageous mathematical claim. There would follow a\n",
    "second pause to let the claim sink in... one might reflect if one had time\n",
    "'oh please this can not be correct'... and then he would continue with the\n",
    "portentous remark, \"Now nobody can stop me from *making this claim*...\". \n",
    "And then of course an argument would follow step by step, and at the conclusion\n",
    "one was obliged to concede: The ridiculous claim was quite reasonable; and in \n",
    "fact would need to be filed away in our mathematical world view.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As freshmen we did not always appreciate the fun of this narrative style. \n",
    "But in retrospect, some 40-odd years later, I can say that I get it, slow \n",
    "though I may be on the uptake. My point is that Tommy took the burden of \n",
    "proof very seriously. He was not the sort to resort to a lazy 'it turns out \n",
    "that...'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my intent is to start over with Tommy on the topic of number theory. \n",
    "It seems like a topic I've always had some affinity with; and here we have\n",
    "Professor Apostol's undergraduate text \n",
    "<u>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</u> to work through. I come to\n",
    "the table knowing some random facts. $1$ is neither prime nor composite; \n",
    "$1$ is simply $1$. Numbers larger than $1$ have precisely one prime \n",
    "factorization. That's probably sufficient to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the book a bit I find some spade work on the greatest common divisor\n",
    "in chapter one; and then follows inexhorable chapter two: Introducing the \n",
    "Möbius $\\mu(n)$ function and Euler's totient $\\varphi(n)$. Chapter two then \n",
    "introduces two new conceptions of multiplication and onwards to matters\n",
    "curiouser and curiouser. Getting through all the exercises of the first two\n",
    "chapters: This is my self-assigned price of admission, with topics to follow \n",
    "in chapters three and onward to include the distribution of primes, finite \n",
    "Abelian groups ('What is purple and commutes?'), quadratic reciprocity, \n",
    "and the mysterious Riemann zeta function itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is all very well but the subject matter is challenging. Hence the \n",
    "metaphor of the student rock climber as cautionary tale. I have no pretentions \n",
    "of mathematical talent but on any given problem an honest attempt invariably\n",
    "pays off with some crumbs of insight. A good example is the task of building\n",
    "a relationship between Mersenne primes and perfect numbers: I would rather ask\n",
    "for help than live in a state of discouragement. To this end: Enter Greg (Chip) \n",
    "Hurst who has published the solution to *every problem found in IANT* at \n",
    "[his website](https://greghurst.wordpress.com/). I rely extensively on this \n",
    "remarkable solution set to light my way."

    "- The second volume (MFADSINT) at a skim bears little resemblance to the subject matter of chapters 1 and 2 in the first volume (IANT).\n",
    "- In the first volume the Fourier transform appears on page 160 and Dirichlet series appears on page 224.\n",
    "- Chapter two introduces arithmetic functions; and chapter 3 looks at the averages of these functions as their argument $n$ grows very large.\n",
    "- In chapter four we start looking at proofs of theorems related to the prime number theorem. We do not see a PNT proof (analytic) however until chapter 13. "
